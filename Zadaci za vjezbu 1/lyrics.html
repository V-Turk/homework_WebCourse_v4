[Intro: Sting]
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV

[Verse 1: Mark Knopfler]
Now look at them yo-yo's, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin,' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

[Chorus: Mark Knopfler & Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

[Verse 2: Mark Knopfler]
See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup?
Yeah buddy, that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot, he's a millionaire

[Chorus: Knopfler & Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

[Ad Lib: Mark Knopfler]
Hoover mover
Uh

[Chorus: Sting & Mark Knopfler]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries, we got
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

[Ad Lib: Knopfler]
Looky here, look out

[Verse 3: Mark Knopfler & Sting]
I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera, man, we could have some
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free

[Chorus: Mark Knopfler & Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

[Verse 4: Mark Knopfler & Sting]
Listen here
Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin', and your chicks for free

[Outro: Mark Knopfler & Sting]
Money for nothin', and chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Get your money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free
Money for nothin', chicks for free

[Outro: Mark Knopfler, Sting, and (Sting)]
Money for nothin'
Yeah
Chicks for free
What's that?
Get your money for nothin', chicks for free
Look at that, look at that
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Bozos
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Ah, money for nothin'
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Easy, easy money for nothin'
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Easy, easy
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Easy, easy money for nothin'
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
That ain't workin'

[Outro: Sting]
Money for nothin', chicks for free

            <i><pre>
[Verse 1]
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[[Solo: Adrian Smith]
Solo: Dave Murray]

[Verse 3]
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh</pre></i>

            <i><pre>
[Chorus]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight? oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 1]
Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

[Chorus]
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, Iâ€™ve been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 2]
Well, I remember!
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget?
It's the first time, the last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
Well, the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me

[Drum solo]

[Chorus]
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord

[Outro]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight! Oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life! Oh Lord!
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord!
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life! Oh Lord, Oh Lord!
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord!
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life! Oh Lord, Oh Lord!
I can feel it in the air tonight...

        <p>
            <i><pre>
[Verse 1]
From the mist, a shape, a ship, is taking form
And the silence of the sea is about to drift into a storm
Sign of power, show of force
Raise the anchor, battleship's plotting its course

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion, king of the ocean

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

[Verse 2]
Two thousand men, and fifty thousand tons of steel
Set the course for the Atlantic with the Allies on their heel
Firepower, firefight
Battle Stations, keep the targets steady in sight

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Into formation, the hunt has begun
Death and damnation, the fleet is coming

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
At the bottom of the ocean, the depths of the abyss
They are bound by iron and blood
The flagship of the navy, the terror of the seas
His guns have gone silent at last

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion, king of the ocean

[Chorus]
He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the war machine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

[Outro]
To lead the war machine
Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
To lead the war machine
Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

[Intro]
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
